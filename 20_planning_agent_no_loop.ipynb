      "An AI agent is a system or entity that uses artificial intelligence techniques to perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously and can be found in various applications, ranging from simple rule-based systems to complex machine learning models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of AI agents include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Perception**: AI agents can gather information from their environment through sensors or data inputs. This could involve processing visual data, audio signals, or other forms of input.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decision-Making**: Based on the information they perceive, AI agents can analyze the data and make decisions. This can involve reasoning, planning, and learning from past experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Action**: After making decisions, AI agents can take actions to interact with their environment. This could involve physical actions (like a robot moving) or digital actions (like a software agent executing commands).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Autonomy**: Many AI agents operate with a degree of autonomy, meaning they can perform tasks without human intervention. However, some may require human oversight or input.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Learning**: Some AI agents are designed to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time, often using techniques from machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI agents can be categorized into different types, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reactive Agents**: These agents respond to specific stimuli in their environment without maintaining a memory of past interactions.\n",
      "- **Deliberative Agents**: These agents have a model of the world and can plan and reason about their actions.\n",
      "- **Learning Agents**: These agents can adapt their behavior based on past experiences and improve their performance over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of AI agents include virtual assistants (like Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles, chatbots, recommendation systems, and game-playing AI.\n"
